Initial commit: CertForge TLS Certificate Generator

This commit introduces CertForge, a simple command-line tool for working with TLS certificates. Features include:

- Certificate Signing Request (CSR) generation
- Self-signed certificate creation
- Subject Alternative Names (SANs) support
- Certificate decoding and analysis
- Output directory specification
- Customizable validity periods

The tool provides an interactive interface that guides users through the process of creating certificates with all required fields and offers command-line options for automation.
